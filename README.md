## Vue to a Burger

### Overview

In this OPTIONAL assignment, you're going to take the `Eat-Da-Burger` app from last week and convert the front end to use Vue.  When you are done, the app should work the same as before.

### Before you Begin

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.



## Instructions


* As a starting point for what you should modify [this Repo](https://github.com/dscarlin/eat-da-burger).

* Start by merging the backend node+sequelize code from the backend into the template.  You can use Postman to test your code while you're working on this.

* Analyse the existing front-end code and decide how you would break it up into Vue components.

* Start creating your components in the client folder of the template.  During development, use the `npm start` command from the template to have your node server and the Vue app running simultaneously, and hot-reloading whenever you change the code.

* When you finish, your site should function just like the original.
